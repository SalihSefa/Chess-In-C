# Chess In C Programming Language
This is an CLI based chess game made with C programming language. It complies with ANSI standard to improve compatibility and portability. Users can play this game just 

**Tech used:** C

Tree data structure and BFS algorithm was used to evaluate all possible movements. Computer assess all possible positions in the movement tree and plays the most valuable movement. After each movement the board status is printed.

## Lessons Learned:
- Tree data structure
- BFS algorithm

## Compatibility
The Box2D library and samples build and run on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

This project was written in ANSI C. So, you will need to use GCC.

## Building and installing
- cd chess
- make
- ./chess (if you use Windows ./chess.exe)
